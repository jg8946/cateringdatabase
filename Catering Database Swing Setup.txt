Setup and Readme for Catering Database Swing

-------------
Initial setup
-------------

This Java Swing project requires a connection to a Java Derby database using a suitable driver. 
To create the initial database, rightclick the Java DB node within NetBeans services window and click "create database".
The name of the database should be "orderdb" with a name and password of "app". The line of code defining the connection
URL (1313 in the unaltered file) may have to be changed to correctly point to this database instance.

For the data tables, utilize the following commands as an SQL query:

CREATE TABLE "CLIENT" (
     "NAME" VARCHAR(400),
     "EMAIL" VARCHAR(400),
     "PASSWORD" VARCHAR(400)
);
CREATE TABLE "STAFFMEMBER" (
     "ACCESSLEVEL" VARCHAR(400),
     "NAME" VARCHAR(400),
     "EMAIL" VARCHAR(400),
     "PASSWORD" VARCHAR(400)
);
CREATE TABLE "GOODSORDER" (
    "ID" int NOT NULL GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY (START WITH 1, INCREMENT BY 1),
    "CUSTNAME" VARCHAR(400),
    "ADDRESSLINEONE" VARCHAR(400),
    "ADDRESSLINETWO" VARCHAR(400),
    "POSTCODE" VARCHAR(400),
    "COST" DOUBLE,
    "GOODS" VARCHAR(400),
    "REQUESTS" VARCHAR(400),
    "STATUS" VARCHAR(400),
    "STAFFNAME" VARCHAR(400)  
);

To create a "admin" staff account that can access all functionality, enter the following SQL query:
INSERT INTO STAFFMEMBER (ACCESSLEVEL, NAME, EMAIL, PASSWORD) VALUES ("Can delete", 'Admin', 'Admin', 'AccessAll');

------------------
Using the program
------------------
The program allows users to either log in as a client, (who can view or place their own orders), or as a staff member
(who can create and modify client, staff and order data.) Staff may also delete data if they have a value of "Can delete"
in the ACCESSLEVEL field of their table entry.

A user must provide their name and password on initial loading of the program. After logging in successfully, they will be
taken to either the client or staff menus for viewing and editing the data tables. 
For staff the main menu provides the options to go to views of client, staff and order data, or to log out. From these
tables, the staff member can go to forms to create, modify and delete. Clients can view their orders, create a new entry,
or log out.
